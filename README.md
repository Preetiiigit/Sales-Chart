ðŸ“Š New Power BI Sales Analytics: Sales Analysis Visual!

I'm excited to share a Visual I recently created: a fully interactive Sales Analysis visual report built using Microsoft Power BI Desktop.
The data came in as a raw Excel file 
The Power BI chart shows the sales distribution among the top N salespeople compared to all other salespeople.

ðŸ“ŠInsights from the Chart:
ðŸš€ 41.9% of sales driven by just 10 people!
Our latest Power BI dashboard reveals a fascinating insight:
 The top 10 salespeople contribute nearly half of total sales, with Kelci Walkden leading at 1.52M sales. The remaining sales (19.79M) are widely spread across the rest of the team.

What does this tell us?
Recognizing and empowering high performers is crucial.
Thereâ€™s a big opportunity to replicate their success strategies across the wider sales force.
Data-driven insights like these help us focus on where the real impact lies.
